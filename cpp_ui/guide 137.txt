FIRE
· When material is not involved in fire, do not use water on material itself.
Small Fire
· Dry chemical or CO2.
· If it can be done safely, move undamaged containers away from the area around the fire.
Large Fire
· Flood fire area with large quantities of water, while knocking down vapors with water fog. If insufficient water supply, responders should withdraw.
Fire Involving Tanks or Car/Trailer Loads
· Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out.
· Do not get water inside containers.
· Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank.
· ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire.
SPILL OR LEAK
· Do not touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing.
· Stop leak if you can do it without risk.
· Use water spray to reduce vapors; do not put water directly on leak, spill area or inside container.
· Keep combustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material.
Small Spill
· Cover with DRY earth, DRY sand or other non-combustible material followed with plastic sheet to minimize spreading or contact with rain.
· Use clean, non-sparking tools to collect material and place it into loosely covered plastic containers for later disposal.
· Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.
