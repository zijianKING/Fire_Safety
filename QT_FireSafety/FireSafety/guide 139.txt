FIRE
· DO NOT USE WATER OR FOAM. (FOAM MAY BE USED FOR CHLOROSILANES, SEE BELOW)
Small Fire
· Dry chemical, soda ash, lime or sand.
Large Fire
· DRY sand, dry chemical, soda ash or lime or withdraw from area and let fire burn.
· FOR CHLOROSILANES, DO NOT USE WATER; use AFFF alcohol-resistant medium-expansion foam; DO NOT USE dry chemicals, soda ash or lime on chlorosilane fires (large or small) as they may release large quantities of hydrogen gas that may explode.
· If it can be done safely, move undamaged containers away from the area around the fire.
Fire Involving Tanks or Car/Trailer Loads
· Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles.
· Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out.
· Do not get water inside containers.
· Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank.
· ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire.
SPILL OR LEAK
· ELIMINATE all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames) from immediate area.
· Do not touch or walk through spilled material.
· Stop leak if you can do it without risk.
· DO NOT GET WATER on spilled substance or inside containers.
· Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material.
· FOR CHLOROSILANES, use AFFF alcohol-resistant medium-expansion foam to reduce vapors.
Small Spill
· Cover with DRY earth, DRY sand or other non-combustible material followed with plastic sheet to minimize spreading or contact with rain.
· Dike for later disposal; do not apply water unless directed to do so.
Powder Spill
· Cover powder spill with plastic sheet or tarp to minimize spreading and keep powder dry.
· DO NOT CLEAN-UP OR DISPOSE OF, EXCEPT UNDER SUPERVISION OF A SPECIALIST.
